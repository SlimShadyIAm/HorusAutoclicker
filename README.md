# Horus Clicker

## Wat dis?

Waiting to sign off your assignments sucks. This will add you to the sign off list as soon as it is available by checking every millisecond

## Installation

- You'll need Firefox for this (version shouldn't matter)
- Download a clone of this GitHub repository and extract the zip file anywhere
- Go to `about:debugging` > `This Firefox`
- Click load temporary extension and select the extracted version of the repository anywhere
- Now, enter a Horus room. You'll know the extension is active because the page should have a red border.
- whenever you're in a Horus room the extension should start and you'll be added to sign off.
- **_Important_**: When you're signed off make sure to remove the temporary extension otherwise it'll readd you to the list.
